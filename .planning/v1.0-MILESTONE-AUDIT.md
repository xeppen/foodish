# Milestone v1.0 Audit

**Type:** Manual Verification (no formal GSD execution artifacts)
**Audited:** 2026-02-12
**Production URL:** https://foodish-red.vercel.app
**Repository:** https://github.com/xeppen/foodish

## Overview

This milestone delivered a minimal meal planning tool that removes dinner decisions in under 60 seconds. All 5 phases were completed and deployed to production. This audit verifies requirements coverage based on ROADMAP.md success criteria and production deployment status.

**Note:** This project was built without formal GSD phase execution, so no VERIFICATION.md files exist. This audit is based on:
- ROADMAP.md success criteria (all marked complete)
- REQUIREMENTS.md traceability
- Production deployment status
- Git commit history

## Cross-Phase Integration

### Database Schema → Authentication → Meal Management
- ✅ Prisma schema supports user-scoped meals
- ✅ Clerk authentication integrates with database queries
- ✅ User sessions properly scope meal data

### Meal Management → Planning Logic
- ✅ Weekly plans draw from user's meal list
- ✅ Empty meal list handled gracefully (starter pack)
- ✅ Meal CRUD operations update available pool for planning

### Planning Logic → Plan Adjustment
- ✅ Swap functionality integrates with plan generation logic
- ✅ Recency constraints respected during swaps
- ✅ Plan persistence maintains state across adjustments

### All Phases → Production Deployment
- ✅ Environment variables configured (Clerk, Neon PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Database schema deployed to production
- ✅ Build and deployment successful
- ✅ Compatibility issues resolved (Prisma v5, React 18, Zod v4)

**Integration status:** All cross-phase dependencies verified.

## End-to-End Flows

### Flow 1: New User Onboarding
1. User visits app → redirected to sign-in
2. User signs in with Google (Clerk OAuth)
3. First-time user sees starter pack of 18 meals
4. User can edit/delete/add meals
5. User navigates to planning
6. **Status:** ✅ Complete

### Flow 2: Weekly Plan Generation
1. Authenticated user navigates to dashboard/planning
2. System checks for existing plan for current week
3. If none exists, auto-generates plan with 5 weekday meals
4. Plan respects recency constraints (avoids recent meals)
5. Plan persists across sessions
6. **Status:** ✅ Complete

### Flow 3: Plan Adjustment
1. User views current week's plan
2. User clicks to swap a specific day
3. System generates new meal respecting recency
4. Only that single day updates (not entire week)
5. Change persists
6. **Status:** ✅ Complete

### Flow 4: Multi-Week Planning
1. User views current week's plan
2. User navigates to next week
