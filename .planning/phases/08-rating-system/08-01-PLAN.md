# 08-01 Plan: Rating Toggle UI in Meal Management

## Objective
Add a compact thumbs-up / neutral / thumbs-down control to meal rows in the drawer list.

## Scope
- New `RatingToggle` component for three-state selection.
- Integrate toggle into `MealList` rows.
- Keep row density and edit affordance intact.

## Tasks
1. Create `components/rating-toggle.tsx` with clear active states.
2. Render toggle in non-edit row mode in `components/meal-list.tsx`.
3. Keep keyboard/accessibility support and prevent accidental row-edit trigger conflicts.

## Verification
- Toggle visible for each meal in drawer.
- Active state matches meal rating.
- Mobile and desktop drawer layouts remain readable.

## Success Criteria
- `RATING-01` and `RATING-03` UI portions are satisfied.
