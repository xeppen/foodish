# 10-04 Plan: Counts + Zero-Result Fallback + Final Tests

## Objective
Complete filter UX with count labels and graceful zero-result fallback.

## Scope
- Show result counts for filter categories.
- If filtered options are zero, show fallback suggestions + explanation.
- Add/extend tests for swap options and choice-based swap.

## Verification
- Count labels visible in filter UI.
- Zero-result state renders fallback options.
- Test/lint/build all pass.
