# 10-03 Plan: Progressive Disclosure Filter UI

## Objective
Add optional filter-based swap flow while preserving fast path as primary.

## Scope
- Add "Byt med filter" secondary action.
- Add filter controls: complexity, rating, recency.
- Show filtered option list and allow explicit selection.

## Verification
- Fast swap remains top CTA.
- Filter UI is collapsed by default.
- User can pick specific replacement meal from filtered options.
