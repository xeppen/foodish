# 10-02 Plan: Preloaded Fast Swap + Background Refresh

## Objective
Make one-click swap instant by using preloaded candidates.

## Scope
- Preload at least 4 candidates per day when cards mount.
- Fast swap uses preloaded first option with optimistic update.
- Refresh candidate pool in background after swap.

## Verification
- Click swap updates meal immediately.
- Network requests for preload happen before first swap.
- Pool refreshes after each swap.
