# 09-02 Plan: Complexity Definitions in UI

## Objective
Expose clear complexity definitions where users manage meals.

## Scope
- Show plain-language definitions:
  - `Simple` <30 min
  - `Medium` 30-60 min
  - `Complex` >60 min
- Place definitions in meal management context (drawer/list), not plan cards.

## Tasks
1. Add concise helper text in meal management UI.
2. Ensure text appears on desktop and mobile drawer layouts.
3. Keep copy compact and non-blocking.

## Verification
- Definitions visible while creating/editing meals.
- No layout breakage in drawer on mobile or desktop.

## Success Criteria
- `COMPLEX-04` satisfied with clear time-based guidance.
